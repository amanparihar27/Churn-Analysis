# Customer Churn Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn risk based on various factors, including transaction behavior, complaints, referrals, and discount usage. The dataset consists of **28,373 customers**, and insights are drawn from **univariate and bivariate analysis** to understand key churn drivers.

- **54% of customers have a high churn risk**, while **46% have a low churn risk**.

### **2. Gender & Region-Based Churn Trends**
- **Gender has minimal impact on churn** (50.06% Female, 49.79% Male).
- **Customers from towns have the highest churn rate (57%)**, while village customers have the lowest (43%).
